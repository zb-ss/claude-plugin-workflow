#+TITLE: Turbo Mode Configuration
#+MODE_NAME: turbo
#+DESCRIPTION: Maximum speed with parallel execution

* Overview

Turbo mode optimizes for speed using parallel agent execution
and haiku models where possible. Best for experienced developers
who will review the output themselves.

* Agent Routing

| Phase | Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Planning | architect-lite | haiku | Quick analysis |
| Implementation | executor-lite | haiku | Fast implementation |
| Code Review | reviewer-lite | haiku | Quick review |
| Security | security-lite | haiku | Basic security scan |

* Phase Defaults

** Planning
- Minimal exploration
- Quick file identification
- Skip deep analysis

** Implementation
- Direct implementation
- Minimal validation
- Trust the plan

** Review
- Advisory only (non-blocking)
- Quick pattern matching
- User responsible for final review

* Parallel Execution

Turbo mode runs these phases in parallel where possible:
- Code review and security scan run simultaneously
- Multiple file implementations can run in parallel

* When to Use

- Quick prototypes
- Simple bug fixes
- Time-sensitive changes
- Developer will do manual review
- Non-critical code paths

* Warnings

- Reviews are advisory, not blocking
- May miss subtle issues
- Recommended for experienced developers
- Always do manual review before merge
