#+TITLE: Turbo Mode Configuration
#+MODE_NAME: turbo
#+DESCRIPTION: Maximum speed with parallel execution

* Overview

Turbo mode optimizes for speed using parallel agent execution
and haiku models where possible. Best for experienced developers
who will review the output themselves.

* Agent Routing

*CRITICAL: Always use =workflow:= prefixed agents to ensure native tool usage*

| Phase | Subagent Type | Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|-------|---------|
| Codebase Analysis | workflow:codebase-analyzer | sonnet | Extract conventions (use cache if available) |
| Planning | workflow:architect-lite | haiku | Quick analysis |
| Implementation | workflow:executor-lite | haiku | Fast implementation with native tools |
| Code Review | workflow:reviewer-lite | haiku | Quick review |
| Security | workflow:security-lite | haiku | Basic security scan |

*NEVER use built-in agents without =workflow:= prefix*

* Review Chain

* Parallel Execution

Turbo mode maximizes parallelism:
- Code review + Security review ALWAYS parallel
- Multiple file implementations can run in parallel
- Code and security reviews are BLOCKING

* Phase Defaults

** Planning
- Minimal exploration
- Quick file identification
- Skip deep analysis

** Implementation
- Direct implementation
- Minimal validation
- Trust the plan

** Review
- BLOCKING (must pass)
- Quick pattern matching
- Issues must be resolved before completion

* Parallel Execution

Turbo mode runs these phases in parallel where possible:
- Code review and security scan run simultaneously
- Multiple file implementations can run in parallel

* When to Use

- Quick prototypes
- Simple bug fixes
- Time-sensitive changes
- Developer will do manual review
- Non-critical code paths

* Warnings

- Reviews are blocking but use lite agents for speed
- May miss subtle issues
- Recommended for experienced developers
- Always do manual review before merge
