#+TITLE: Standard Mode Configuration
#+MODE_NAME: standard
#+DESCRIPTION: Balanced approach with good quality and reasonable speed

* Overview

Standard mode provides a balanced approach between speed and quality.
Uses sonnet model for most tasks with single-pass code review.

* Agent Routing

*CRITICAL: Always use =workflow:= prefixed agents to ensure native tool usage*

| Phase | Subagent Type | Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|-------|---------|
| Codebase Analysis | workflow:codebase-analyzer | sonnet | Extract conventions and patterns |
| Planning | Plan | sonnet | Built-in planning agent (read-only) |
| Implementation | workflow:executor | sonnet | Standard implementation with native tools |
| Code Review | workflow:reviewer | sonnet | Standard code review |
| Security | workflow:security | sonnet | Standard security audit |
| Tests | workflow:test-writer | sonnet | Test generation |

*Always use =workflow:= prefixed agents for all tasks except the built-in =Plan= agent*

* Review Chain

* Parallel Execution

Reviews can run in parallel on first pass:
- Code review + Security review (first iteration)
- If either fails, subsequent iterations are sequential

* Phase Defaults

** Planning
- Use built-in Plan agent
- Create org file for state tracking
- Explore codebase before planning

** Implementation
- Use workflow:executor agent
- Follow plan strictly
- Minimal deviation allowed
- Always use Write/Edit tools, never bash for file ops

** Review
- Single code review pass
- Security review required
- Performance review optional

* When to Use

- Regular feature development
- Standard bug fixes
- Routine refactoring
- Default choice for most tasks
